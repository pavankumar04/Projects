# Week #3: Course Materials
  * Java
  * JDBI
  * Maven

The primary objective of week #3 is to complete the Cli fully with Booking, Room_allocation, Guest and room_Details in application. 

We will also start doing standups from this week. https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/daily-scrum

Each day, as the team does the standup, one from each team notes down briefly the answers to the three questions for each team member and send it to the facilitators.

  Here is a rough format (for each team)

  Subject: MLP{nn} daily standup â€“ {date}
  
{team member#1}:
  * Yesterday:
    * Completed {blah}, In progress {blah}
  * Today:
    * Will complete {blah}, Will start {blah}
  * Impediments:
    * {Things like machine issues, network issues etc}
    
{team member #2:
   * ...
   
Ideally, the blahs above should include the ticket number MLP{nn}-{jj}

    triggered (within 5 minutes of the merge) and it will execute the unit tests etc. It then will trigger the integration 
    job which will perform black box tests on the package. And finally the application will be deployed on staging.
